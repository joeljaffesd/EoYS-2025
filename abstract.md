# A Framework & Toolkit for Music Performance in the AlloSphere
The AlloSphere Research Facility at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is a pioneering multimedia research environment used extensively for multimodal synthesis and data visualization. However, it has rarely been explored for live popular music performanceâ€”a key area with potential for industry collaboration. This project develops, documents, and demonstrates a framework and toolkit for utilizing the facility in this context, laying the foundation for future endeavors.
